            <h2>Tips for Choosing the Right Wireless Nursing Bra</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consider Your Lifestyle:</strong> If you’re very active, look for bras with more support. If comfort for lounging is key, softer, less structured options are ideal.</li>
                <li><strong>Material Matters:</strong> Opt for breathable, soft fabrics like cotton, bamboo, or modal blends, which are gentle on sensitive skin and can help with temperature regulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Easy Access:</strong> Ensure the nursing clasps or pull-aside features are easy to operate with one hand, especially when holding a baby.</li>
                <li><strong>Removable Pads:</strong> These can offer extra modesty and absorb leaks, but ensure they don’t add unnecessary bulk or shift around.</li>
                <li><strong>Try Before You Buy:</strong> If possible, try on bras to ensure a comfortable and supportive fit. Your size can fluctuate significantly during pregnancy and postpartum.</li>
            </ul>
